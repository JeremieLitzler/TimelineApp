The modal's title is "Options"

And we have:

- [ ] A button "Edit"
  - Clicking it brings up the [New Project Screen](new-project-screen.md) with the project's color and name prefilled.
- [ ] A button "New record"
  - Clicking it brings up the [New Record Screen](add-new-record-screen.md)
- [ ] A button "New task"
  - Clicking it brings up the [New Task Modal](add-new-task-modal.md)
- [ ] A button "Archive"
  - Clicking it archives the project. On the [Project Screen](project-screen.md), the title is preceeded by "Archived".
- [ ] A button "Delete"
  - It is greyed out if the project isn't archived
  - Clicking it brings a modal asking to confirm deletion. See more about it [here](project-delete-modal.md)
