# Project Screen

When on the [Project Selection Modal](project-selection-modal.md) from the [Timeline Screen](timeline-screen.md), selecting a project brings us to that project.

When on the [Project Selection Modal](project-selection-modal.md) from the [Edit A Record Screen](edit-record-screen.md), after selecting the "Back" button on the [Select A Task Modal](select-a-task-modal.md), selecting a project brings us to the edited record and updates the record to be linked to the selected project.

The elements of the screen are:

- On top:
  - [ ] A "back" button to go back to the [Timeline Screen](timeline-screen.md).
  - [ ] The project name as title
  - [ ] A "three-dot" menu to bring the [Project Edit Modal](project-edit-modal.md)

  - [the Tasks tab](project-screen-on-the-tasks-tab.md)
  - [the Stats tab](project-screen-on-the-statistics-tab.md)
- On the bottom:
