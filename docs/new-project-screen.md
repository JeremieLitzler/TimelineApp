# New Project Screen

When clicking the button "+ Add New Project" on the [Project Selection Modal](project-selection-modal.md), we have:

- [ ] an input to set the project name.
- [ ] a list of colors to pick from to set the project color.
- [ ] a back button with an arrow icon on the top left of the screen
  - [ ] The back button goes back to the [Timeline Screen](timeline-screen.md).
- [ ] a "Save" button on the top right of the screen once at least one caracter is typed in the input field.
  - [ ] The default color is the first in the list.
  - [ ] Clicking "Save" goes back to the [Projects Screen](timeline-screen.md).
    - I think it'd make sense to go to the project itself.
    - In fact, when I create a project, it means that I want to use it or create tasks for it.
    - Maybe, a modal with the following choices would be nice:
      - Go back to Projects
      - Go to {{ name }} (see [Project Screen](project-screen.md))
      - Add a task to {{ name }}

Here is the color palette.
