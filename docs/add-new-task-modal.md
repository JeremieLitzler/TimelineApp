The modal includes:

- [ ] The project's name, with a tiny circle in its color on its left.
- [ ] An input to enter the task name with a placeholder "New task".
- [ ] A "Save" button
  - [ ] The task name is required to add the task
- [ ] Tapping or clicking outside the modal closes it.
- [ ] When coming from the [Select A Task Modal](select-a-task-modal.md), we go back to that modal
- [ ] When coming from the [Tasks tab](project-screen-on-the-tasks-tab.md) of [the Project Screen](project-screen.md), we go back to the Tasks tab.
