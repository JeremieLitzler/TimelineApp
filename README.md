# TimelineApp

A web version of Boosted application on Android.

The functionnality will be very similar, but the application will use:

- A Vue 3 frontend
- A Supabase backend (Nano-pricing)
- A Servive worker to make a PWA so you can use it offline

I'll describe you how to host your own Timeline app on Netlify.

I won't go into self-hosting the Web App or Supabase. Both are possible. You'll need your own VPS for that.
